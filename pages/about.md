I am currently working as a bioinformatics technician in Dr. Frederick Rothâ€™s Lab at the University of Toronto.

My main interests include: Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Statistical Methods and Algorithms. B
 
Most importantly, I enjoy learning about all different kinds of things. So I made this blog where I can take notes, walk through interesting algorithms and understand math/statistical problems.
 
Here you can find my code (and walk thru), interesting articles, interesting algorithms and things I want to learn.
