> a measure of the quality of binary (two-class) classifications, 
introduced by biochemist Brian W. Matthews in 1975. It takes 
into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally 
regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the 
classes are of very different sizes. The MCC is in essence 
a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted 
binary classifications; it returns a value between −1 and +1. 
A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better 
than random prediction and −1 indicates total disagreement between 
prediction and observation. The statistic is also known as the 
phi coefficient. MCC is related to the chi-square statistic for 
a 2×2 contingency table
