#### Introduction

PLAsTiCC is intended to simulate sources that vary with 
time in the night-sky as seen during the first three 
years of operation of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).

The LSST is a telescope with an 8.4 meter primary mirror diameter being built high up 
in Atacama desert of Chile, on a mountain called Cerro Pachon.

**How Astronomers have Studied Astronomical Sources Thus Far**


To determine the class of any particular astrophysical source, 
we currently need lots of observational data.

At present, we classify the sources not using just their light 
curves, but using more detailed follow-up with other telescopes. 
We use "spectrographs" - instruments that, much like a prism, 
disperse a beam of light, spreading different colors over position - to study astrophysical sources.
