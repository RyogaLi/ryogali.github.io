Although Jekyll and Github Pages provided many useful tutorials about how to create your own website or blog, as a person who only knows the basics of web programming (basic CSS, html, databases and markdown), I am writing this post to summarize the steps I went through to build a website.

### Initializing the repository on Github and installing Jekyll ###

To initializing the repository on Github, here is a nice summary from Github - [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

To create a new Jekyll website, here is a tut from Jekyll - [Quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)

After initializing by running `jekyll new your-dir`, the default theme is called `minima`. You will find the structure of the repo as stated in [understanding gem based themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes). From this basic structure we can start to build our own website. 

#### Basics about the theme

The default theme for Jekyll is `minima`. In the `_config.yml`, you can change the basic things of the website like `title` and `description`. 

If you want to modify any part of this theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), you can create folders and file names to overwrite the original layout. A more detailed explanation can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults).

#### [Type on Strap](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap)

Here I am using the theme called Type on Strap developed by Sylhare as the templete for this website. Please find the detailed information about this theme [!here](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap).
